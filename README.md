# D2_project

This is a repository for the group project for the module ITNPBD2 Representing Data on the MSc Big Data 2018/2019 at Stirling University.

The project focuses on the manipulation and representation of data using the Python language and JSON data format.

---Code---

'Combine_old_and_new_data_tw.py' - This combines the new data generated by 'Scrape_updated_data_tw.py' with the origional data which was converted to a JSON in 'Read_csv_to_JSON_tw.py'

'Read_csv_to_JSON_tw.py' - This converts 'CharityCharacteristics.csv' into 'active_data_file.json' by way of a pandas dataframe

'Scrape_updated_data_tw.py' - This scrapes new data from the Charity Commisison website for each charity in 'active_data_file.json' and saves it as 'new_scrape_data.json'

---Data---

'CharityCharacteristics.csv' - This is the origional data set held in CSV format

'active_data_file.json' - This is the origional data converted into a JSON

'new_scrape_data.json' - This is the new data resulting from 'Scrape_updated_data.py'
